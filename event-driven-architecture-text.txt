EVENT DRIVEN ARCHITECHER:-
--------------------------


>> this is for events to decouple an application components.


in this we have mainly four components

1. event producers

2. event ingestion

3. event stream

4. event consumers

used in many use cases

>> loosely coupled applications.

>> add new features without changing existing applications.

>> scale and fail components independently.






>> create S3 bucket  


>> create SNS topic

in the process of creating sns topic change the access policys for s3 and sqs .

>> create SQS

change the access policy place the json

as like that create a the 3 queues

>> create IAM role for lambda function

go through lambda function policy json 

create 3 for 3 lambdas



>>  create lambda

create the 3 lambda functions


go to s3 > properties > event notifications > create'

in that attach to sns topic


then go to sns and subcrribe the sqs 

write filter policy  for put

as like that subcribe 2nd sqs

write filter policy  for copy


go to sqs for trigger the lambda
